Arduino my_rest_clock

The goal of this mini project is to create a clock for resting in between workout sets
This circuit uses a push button to start the clock, and a piezo device as a ringer for when the rest time is up.

rest_time - variable to represent the rest time in between exercises (in milliseconds)
note_time - variable to represent the duration of the ringer for the clock (in milliseconds)
note - frequency at which the ringer tone is sent to piezo device
keyVal - input variable for push button. Its value is dependent upon the voltage across the push button (1023 in this case)
threshold - this variable is used for comparison to determine whether or not the push button has been pressed and timer should start
debounce_delay - Push buttons sometimes 'bounce' and cause multiple triggers, this variable is used for bounce error checking

An if statement is used to start and stop the clock in the loop function
The logic goes as
- if the push button has been pressed
	- briefly delay for push button bounce (error checking)
	- delay for requested rest_time (start rest clock)
	- send note to piezo (timer ringer)
	- delay for the note time (hold note for brief time)
	- stop the ringer
- else
	- stop the ringer

The delay() function is used as a blocking function to stop the CPU from performing other tasks until the specified time is up
